php Minecraft 3D Skin Renderer
=====================

Render a 3D view of a Minecraft skin using PHP.

Project first developed by <a href="https://github.com/supermamie/php-Minecraft-3D-skin" target="_blank">supermamie</a>. The intention of this fork was to translate the whole php file into English.

I have also used the traditional php naming conventions whenever needed for variable names using the underscore notation instead of the camel notation used previously.
