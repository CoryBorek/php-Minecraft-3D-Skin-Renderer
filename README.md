php Minecraft 3D Skin Renderer
=====================

Render a 3D view of a Minecraft skin using PHP.

Project first developed by <a href="https://github.com/supermamie/php-Minecraft-3D-skin" target="_blank">supermamie</a>. Later transalated to English by <a href="https://github.com/cajogos/php-Minecraft-3D-Skin-Renderer" target="_blank">cajogos</a>.

My goal is to fix some issues and hopefully create full support for the 1.8 skins.

### Example of URL:
`http://example.com/cf-mcskin.php?vr=-25&hr=-25&hrh=0&vrla=0&vrra=0&vrll=0&vrrl=0&ratio=12&format=png&displayHair=true&headOnly=false&user=cajogos`

## Changes Made
- Fixed dark blue skins;
- Made 1.8 skins work (still render as the old skin type);
- Made Steve the fallback image.
